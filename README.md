# TODO

## Priority
- [ ] Change User Schema to include all the required info to get Dwolla working. Documentation [here](https://developers.dwolla.com/docs/balance/api-reference/customers/create#verified-personal-customer---request-parameters)
- [ ] Change Sign Up flow. AWS Cognito -> Add info page -> Link Bank Account (Need to change the user attributes on Cognito)

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add user info to the redux store to reduce calls to BE
- [ ] Code cleanup and add comments for future reference
